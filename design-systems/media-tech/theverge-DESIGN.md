# Design System Inspired by The Verge

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

The Verge's 2024 redesign feels like somebody wired a Condé Nast magazine to a chiptune soundboard. The canvas is almost-black (`#131313`), the headlines are built from a brutally heavy display face (Manuka) that runs up to 107px, and the whole page is peppered with acid-mint `#3cffd0` and ultraviolet `#5200ff` that behave less like brand colors and more like hazard tape. Story tiles are not quiet gray cards — they're saturated, full-bleed color blocks (yellow, pink, orange, blue, purple) that feel like pasted-up rave flyers arranged into a timeline. The mood is "developer console meets club night meets tech tabloid": serious enough to cover a congressional hearing, loud enough to review a synthesizer.

What makes this system unmistakable is the **StoryStream** timeline: a vertical feed where every post is a rounded rectangle — often 20–40px radius — filled edge-to-edge with color, framed by a thin border, and marked by a mono-uppercase timestamp on its left rail. Stories don't float on a grid; they stack on a dashed vertical rule like commits in a git log. Above that, a massive **"The Verge" wordmark** dominates the masthead in Manuka at hero scale, letting the reader know before any headline loads that this is editorial territory, not a template.

There is no "light mode" on the homepage — the dark canvas is the product, and the only time the palette inverts is when a single story tile takes a mint or yellow fill. The depth is almost entirely flat: **hairline 1px borders** (`#ffffff`, `#3cffd0`, or `#5200ff`) do the work that shadows would do on a Material-flavored site. Every container is either `#131313` with a 1px outline, a fully saturated accent block, or a slate-gray `#2d2d2d` secondary surface.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-black editorial canvas (`#131313`) as the default surface — no light mode on the homepage
- Acid-mint `#3cffd0` + ultraviolet `#5200ff` as hazard-tape accents, never quiet background wash
- Massive Manuka display headlines up to 107px — the single loudest type move in mainstream tech media
- Rounded pill-card everything: 20/24/30/40px corner radii, never square
- Fully saturated color-block story tiles (mint, purple, yellow, pink, orange, electric blue) on a dark page
- Timeline "StoryStream" feed with mono uppercase timestamps rather than a traditional magazine grid
- Flat depth — 1px borders in white, mint, purple do the work that shadows would do elsewhere

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary (Brand Hazards)
- **Jelly Mint** (`#3cffd0`): The Verge's signature acid-mint accent. Used as CTA button fill, link underlines, active tab borders, and high-attention story-tile backgrounds. Treat it as the visual equivalent of neon safety paint — applied sparingly to the most important element on screen.
- **Verge Ultraviolet** (`#5200ff`): The complementary brand hazard. Used for secondary color-block tiles, promotional spans, and the occasional outlined button. Often applied at 0.9 alpha to soften its cathode intensity.

### Secondary & Accent
- **Console Mint Border** (`#309875`): A darker variant of the jelly mint used on card outlines and button borders where pure mint would over-saturate.
- **Deep Link Blue** (`#3860be`): The link *hover* color — the one moment blue appears on the site. It replaces mint/white/black on hover across every link style.
- **Focus Cyan** (`#1eaedb`): Reserved for button focus rings. Never shown outside a keyboard-focus state.
- **Purple Rule** (`#3d00bf`): A darker ultraviolet variant used as the vertical border on StoryStream `<li>` items.

### Surface & Background
- **Canvas Black** (`#131313`): The default dark surface for the entire homepage. Almost-but-not-quite pure black — has just enough warmth to feel like a printed newsprint negative rather than an OLED void.
- **Surface Slate** (`#2d2d2d`): Secondary card background, used when a story tile doesn't need to be a saturated color block.
- **Image Frame** (`#313131`): The 1px border that wraps inline imagery.
- **Hazard White** (`#ffffff`): Used as story-tile fill, button border, and primary text. When white appears as a large block, it's an editorial decision — a "spotlight" on that tile.
- **Absolute Black** (`#000000`): Reserved for text on the mint/yellow/white tiles — the only place it appears.

### Neutrals & Text
- **Primary Text** (`#ffffff`): Headlines and display text on the canvas.
- **Secondary Text** (`#949494`): Bylines, timestamps, photo credits. The mid-gray that anchors the metadata layer.
- **Muted Text** (`#e9e9e9`): Button text on dark slate buttons. Slightly off-white to reduce screen glare.
- **Inverted Text** (`#131313`): Used only on accent tiles (mint, yellow, white) to keep contrast legible.

### Semantic & Accent
- **Focus Ring** (`#1eaedb`): Keyboard focus only.
- **Overlay Black** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.33)`): Subtle 1px ring used as the quiet shadow alternative on stacked cards.
- **Dim Gray** (`#8c8c8c`): Active/pressed button background — the "pressed down" state.

### Gradient System
The Verge uses **zero decorative gradients**. The only gradient-like treatment is the transition from a saturated accent story tile (mint/purple/yellow) back to the `#131313` canvas between rows. Color is applied in solid blocks, not as washes. This is a deliberate choice — the site's hazard-tape visual identity would dissolve if anything faded.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Manuka** (Klim Type Foundry) — fallback: Impact, Helvetica. The signature display face for The Verge wordmark and feature headlines. A heavy-weight (900) industrial sans-serif with a condensed, almost-athletic stance. Runs at 60–107px on the homepage, never smaller.
- **PolySans** (PanGram Pangram / Nikolas Wrobel) — fallback: Helvetica, Arial. The UI and secondary headline workhorse. Covers weights 300 / 500 / 700 across the system — everything from kicker captions to body decks.
- **PolySans Mono** — fallback: Courier New, Courier. The monospaced sibling, used exclusively for ALL-CAPS labels: kickers, timestamps, category tags, button labels. This mono-uppercase usage is the second-most-identifiable Verge detail after Manuka.
- **FK Roman Standard** (Florian Karsten) — fallback: Georgia. A serif used sparingly for specific body/caption treatments (article excerpts, certain review pulls). Adds a "print-magazine" counterpoint to the PolySans stack.
- **Roboto** — fallback: `-apple-system`, `system-ui`. Utility UI font for widgets and legacy modules.

| Serif Body | FK Roman Standard | 16px / 1.00rem | 400 | 1.30 | -0.16px | Review decks, print-voice excerpts |
| Serif Caption | FK Roman Standard | 20px / 1.25rem | 400 | 1.20 | — | Magazine-style pull quotes |

### Principles
- **Manuka is always the hero, never the UI.** If you see Manuka below 60px you're looking at a bug. It exists to *shout the brand*, not to label a button.
- **PolySans is the workhorse, PolySans Mono is its uniformed sibling.** Mono is used exclusively for UPPERCASE labels, timestamps, tags, and certain buttons. Lowercase mono doesn't exist in this system.
- **Thin-weight (300) capitalized headlines** are a signature Verge move. The 19–20px weight-300 with 1.9px tracking creates a "fashion magazine whisper" that contrasts with the 107px Manuka shout above it. This whisper-vs-shout contrast is the typographic fingerprint.
- **Letter-spacing has two registers**: positive (0.72–1.9px) for ALL-CAPS mono and sans labels, negative (`-0.16px`) for the rare serif appearances, barely-positive (0.32px, 1.07px) for massive display. Plain 0 letter-spacing is rare.
- **FK Roman Standard is the editorial exception**, not the rule. Reserve it for long-form print-voice moments — reviews, critic pulls, masthead essays. Never use it in UI.
- **Line heights are tight** (0.80–1.30) for every display and label, relaxed (1.60–2.00) only for reading body and mono button labels. The leading jump is intentional — it gives the page a "telegraph ticker" rhythm.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px.
- **Scale**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20, 24, 25px.
- **Section padding**: 32–64px vertical between major feed sections.
- **Card padding**: 20–32px interior. Feature cards expand to 40–48px.

### Grid & Container
- **Max width**: ~1280–1300px.
- **Container padding**: 24px mobile / 48px desktop.
- **Gutters**: 16–24px between columns, tighter (8–12px) inside StoryStream items.

### Border Radius Scale
- **2px** — inputs, small badges
- **3px** — inline images
- **4px** — nested card images and small button variants
- **20px** — standard pill cards and color-block tiles
- **24px** — feature tile radius and primary button pill
- **30px** — large promotional buttons
- **40px** — outlined CTA pills
- **50%** — avatar circles, icon buttons

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No border, no shadow | Default `#131313` canvas text |
| 2 | `1px solid #ffffff` or `#313131` hairline | Image frames and quiet card outlines |
| 3 | `1px solid #3cffd0` hairline | Active button outlines, focused story tiles |
| 4 | `1px solid #5200ff` hairline | Promotional/alternate state outlines |
| 5 | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.33) 0px 0px 0px 1px` | The single "atmospheric" ring |
| 6 | `0px -1px 0px 0px inset` (mint/black/white) | Active tab underline |
| 7 | Saturated accent fill | Story-tile elevation via color, not shadow |

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- **Do** use `#131313` as the canvas for every view. There is no light mode.
- **Do** use Jelly Mint (`#3cffd0`) and Verge Ultraviolet (`#5200ff`) as hazard accents.
- **Do** use Manuka exclusively at 60px+ for hero headlines.
- **Do** round everything: 20px for cards, 24px for feature cards, 30–40px for pill buttons.
- **Do** use PolySans Mono for UPPERCASE labels, timestamps, kickers, and button text.
- **Do** apply 1.5–1.9px letter-spacing to every ALL-CAPS label.
- **Do** use saturated color-block tiles to elevate a story — never a drop shadow.
- **Do** use `#3860be` (deep link blue) as the hover color on every link.
- **Do** apply the StoryStream timeline rail on feed views.
- **Do** use thin-weight (300) PolySans at 19–20px with 1.9px tracking for "fashion-whisper" capitalized eyebrows.

### Don't
- **Don't** use a light background. The dark canvas is the product.
- **Don't** add `box-shadow` for elevation. Use 1px borders or saturated accent fills instead.
- **Don't** use square corners. Every interactive and content container is rounded.
- **Don't** use Manuka for UI, buttons, or body copy. It's strictly display.
- **Don't** use lowercase mono. PolySans Mono is always UPPERCASE.
- **Don't** let mint and ultraviolet appear as background washes — they're hazard accents, not canvas tints.
- **Don't** use gradients anywhere. The system is solid color blocks only.
- **Don't** introduce new accent colors outside the declared mint / purple / yellow / pink / orange tile palette.

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Small Mobile | <400px | Single column, Manuka hero scales down to ~48–54px |
| Mobile | 400–549px | Single column, color-block tiles stack full-width |
| Large Mobile | 550–767px | Still single column but padding opens up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | 2-column StoryStream with feature card spanning |
| Small Desktop | 1024–1179px | Full 3–4 column editorial grid |
| Desktop | 1180–1299px | Max padding, Manuka wordmark at full hero scale |
| Large Desktop | ≥1300px | Container caps at ~1280–1300px |

### Touch Targets
- Primary pill buttons are ~44px minimum height — meets WCAG AA.
- Mono uppercase nav links are smaller (~28–32px tall) — pad to 44px on mobile.
- Circle icon buttons are 40–44px circles, touch-friendly.

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Nav**: wordmark scales from hero (Manuka 60–107px) to ~24–32px on mobile. Category links collapse to a hamburger drawer below 900px.
- **Grid**: 4-col → 3-col → 2-col → 1-col.
- **Type**: Manuka hero scales from 107px to ~48–54px on mobile.
